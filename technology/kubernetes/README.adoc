= School Timetabling (OpenShift, Java, Quarkus, Maven)

This demo shows how to use the OptaPlanner Operator to run OptaPlanner workloads on OpenShift.

*Please note that the OptaPlanner Operator used in this demo is experimental. As such, it provides no guarantees
in terms of maturity and backward compatibility.*

== Get your environment running

Use an existing OpenShift cluster or download and start the https://developers.redhat.com/products/codeready-containers/overview[RedHat CodeReady Containers].

WARNING: Be sure to pick the _Red Hat OpenShift Local_, as the other option, the _Developer Sandbox for Red Hat OpenShift_ does not
allow installing new operators.

The CodeReady Containers need more resources to run this demo. Before starting the local cluster, increase the available memory
at least to 16 384 MiB by running `crc config set memory 16384`.

Next, install the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.html[OpenShift CLI (`oc`)]
to be able to interact with the OpenShift cluster.

Login as a user with the `cluster-admin` role using the `oc login` command.

[#installStrimzi]
=== Install Strimzi

The OptaPlanner Operator uses https://strimzi.io/[Strimzi] to create Kafka topics, thus, as the first step, install
Strimzi to your OpenShift instance.

. in the OpenShift console, navigate to the menu _Operators -> Operator Hub_. Find the _Strimzi_ operator and install it
. now, create a new `demo` project by running `oc new-project demo`
. open the _Strimzi_ operator, select the _Kafka_ tab and create a new Kafka cluster. You will need the Kafka cluster name
to create the `Solver` custom resource later

NOTE: The Strimzi topic operator watches the project the Kafka cluster resides in. The rule of thumb is to create
a separate project that contains the Solver resource together with its dependent resources, like Kafka cluster and topics.
For additional options, please refer to https://strimzi.io/documentation/[Strimzi documentation].

=== Deploy the OptaPlanner Operator

The OptaPlanner operator is also a Quarkus application. As such, it's container image can be built and pushed directly to OpenShift using the https://quarkus.io/guides/deploying-to-openshift[`io.quarkus:quarkus-openshift` extension].

. create the `optaplanner-operator` project by running `oc new-project optaplanner-operator`
. run `mvn clean package -Dopenshift`
. apply the generated CRD by running `oc create -f target/kubernetes/solvers.org.optaplanner.solver-v1.yml`
. apply the prepared template by running `oc apply -f src/k8s/openshift.yml`

TIP: If you encounter the `Caused by: javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: sun.security.validator.ValidatorException: PKIX path building failed` exception due to self-signed certificate during the build, add the `-Dquarkus.kubernetes-client.trust-certs=true` property.

=== Deploy the Demo App

The Demo App also relies upon the `quarkus-openshift` extension to deploy to OpenShift. The extension also picks up additional
resources defined in the `src/main/kubernetes/openshift.yml`; in this case, there is a template that creates
the PostgreSQL database to store input problems and solutions.

. change directory to `demo-app`
. create new project called _demo_ by running `oc new-project demo`
. deploy the demo-app via a maven command: `mvn clean package -Dopenshift -Dquarkus.openshift.namespace=demo -Dquarkus.openshift.env.vars.kafka-bootstrap-servers=<kafka bootstrap servers address>`

The `-Dquarkus.openshift.env.vars.kafka-bootstrap-servers` property results in an environment variable `KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS`
in the running container, which Quarkus converts to the `kafka.bootstrap.servers` property, effectively overriding the
`kafka.bootstrap.servers=localhost:9092` in the `application.properties`.

TIP: If you encounter the `Caused by: javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: sun.security.validator.ValidatorException: PKIX path building failed` exception due to self-signed certificate during the build, add the `-Dquarkus.kubernetes-client.trust-certs=true` property.

To find the address of the Kafka bootstrap servers:

. login to the OpenShift UI console
. open the _openshift-operators_ project and navigate to _Networking -> Services_
. open the _<kafka-cluster-name>-kafka-bootstrap_ service and notice its hostname and service port mapping for TCP clients under the _Service routing_ section
. the address is a compound of the `<hostname>:<service port>`

=== Create the school-timetabling solver

Now, when all the other pieces of the puzzle are already in place, it's time to make the school-timetabling running.

[#buildSolverImage]
==== Build and push the school-timetabling container image

In order for the OptaPlanner Operator to create a deployment of the solver project, you need to push it to any container image registry accessible
by your OpenShift instance.

Quarkus comes in handy again, this time with one of the https://quarkus.io/guides/container-image[Quarkus container image extensions], which
builds a container image locally and pushes it to a container image registry.

Build and push the School Timetabling container image to a registry of your choice:

. change directory to `school-timetabling`
. run `mvn clean package -Dopenshift -Dquarkus.container-image.group=<image group> -Dquarkus.container-image.registry=<container registry>
-Dquarkus.container-image.username=<container registry username> -Dquarkus.container-image.password=<container registry password>`

The container registry in the command above is a repository used to store and access container images (e.g. docker.io) and the image group is an organization or a personal account in that registry.

[TIP]
.Pushing an image to a container image registry
====
You can use https://quay.io[quay.io] as a container image registry.

. open https://quay.io in the browser and login with your Red Hat account
. create a new repository called _school-timetabling_, switch its visibility to _Public_ and click the _Create Public Repository_ button
. the image is identified by quay.io/<login>/<image name>:<tag>
====

==== Create the Solver custom resource

The Solver custom resource describes the problem to solve on OpenShift and the infrastructure it requires.
In this case, the `Solver` custom resource might look like follows:

[source yaml]
----
apiVersion: org.optaplanner.solver/v1beta1
kind: Solver
metadata:
  name: school-timetabling <1>
spec:
  kafkaCluster: my-cluster <2>
  kafkaBootstrapServers: my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap.demo.svc.cluster.local:9092 <3>
  solverImage: quay.io/example/school-timetabling:latest  <4>
  scaling:
    replicas: 1 <5>
----

<1> the solver name
<2> the name of the Kafka cluster created during the <<#installStrimzi, Strimzi installation>>
<3> Kafka bootstrap servers address
<4> the school-timetabling container image <<#buildSolverImage, built and pushed>> to a registry of your choice
<5> the number of running school-timetabling pods

Create the `Solver` resource via `oc apply -f <file>`.

Let's check the active pods in the `demo` project by running the `oc get pods` command:

image::img/runningPods.png[Running pods in the demo project]

To see what Kafka topics there are in the `demo` project, run `oc get kafkatopic`:

image::img/kafkaTopics.png[Kafka topics in the demo project]

Both the `school-timetabling-problem` and `school-timetabling-solution` have been created and there is
a single running `school-timetabling` pod.

== Run the demo-app

. find out the Demo App address by running `oc get route`; see the _HOST/PORT_ column of its output
. open the address in the browser
. change the number of lessons, if needed, and click the _Create & send_ button

== Local development

To work locally on this demo without OpenShift or any Kubernetes cluster:

. start the PostgreSQL database and a Kafka broker by running `docker-compose up`
. run the `demo-app` by `mvn quarkus:dev` in the `demo-app` directory
. run the `school-timetabling` by `mvn quarkus:dev` in the `school-timetabling` directory
